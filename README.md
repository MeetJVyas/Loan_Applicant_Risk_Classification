# Loan Applicant Risk Classification Using KNN
In this project I am using KNN to classify and predict loan applicant's risk segments

Project Description:
In this particular project, I am using a dataset that contains information like, Age, Total Work Experience, number of years in city, cost to request ratio etc and using that to classify loan applicantâ€™s Risk segmentation.
However, I first pre-processed the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.

Column details:-

1)Age-Self explanatory

2)Total Work Experience-Work experience in number of years

3)Number of years in city-Self Explanatory

4)Cost to Request Ratio-ratio of cost to request

5)Cibil score=Applicant's cibil score

6)Overdrafts past 12 months-Number of overdrafts in past 12 months

7)Total bounces past 12 months-Number of bounces in past 12 months
